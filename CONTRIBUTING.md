### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names that indicate the type of change:

```bash
feature/add-outlier-detection     # New feature
fix/arima-convergence-issue      # Bug fix
docs/update-api-reference        # Documentation
refactor/improve-performance     # Code refactoring
test/add-integration-tests       # Test additions
```

## üé® Code Style

We maintain high code quality standards with automated tools:

### Python Style Guide

- **Formatting**: [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) with 88-character line length
- **Import Sorting**: [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) with Black profile
- **Linting**: [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) with specific configuration
- **Type Hints**: Required for all new code using [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/)

### Code Quality Checks

Run these commands before submitting:

```bash
# Format code
black src/ tests/

# Sort imports
isort src/ tests/

# Lint code
flake8 src/ tests/

# Type checking
mypy src/

# Security scan
bandit -r src/
```

### Automated Checks

Our CI pipeline automatically runs:
- Code formatting verification
- Import sorting verification
- Linting checks
- Type checking
- Security scanning
- Test suite execution

## üß™ Testing

### Testing Philosophy

- **High Coverage**: Maintain >85% test coverage
- **Quality Tests**: Write meaningful tests, not just for coverage
- **Multiple Levels**: Unit tests, integration tests, performance tests
- **Real Data**: Test with realistic time series data

### Test Organization

```
tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ unit/               # Unit tests for individual components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/        # Integration tests for full workflows  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ performance/        # Performance benchmarks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/              # Test datasets
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fixtures/          # Shared test fixtures
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src/x13_seasonal_adjustment

# Run specific test categories  
pytest -m "unit"          # Unit tests only
pytest -m "integration"   # Integration tests only
pytest -m "not slow"      # Skip slow tests

# Run performance benchmarks
pytest tests/performance/ --benchmark-only
```

### Writing Tests

Follow these guidelines when writing tests:

1. **Use descriptive names**: Test names should clearly describe what's being tested
2. **Follow AAA pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert
3. **Test edge cases**: Include boundary conditions and error cases
4. **Use fixtures**: Share common setup using pytest fixtures
5. **Mock external dependencies**: Use mocking for external services

Example test:

```python
import pytest
from x13_seasonal_adjustment import X13SeasonalAdjustment, DataValidationError

def test_x13_raises_error_for_insufficient_data():
    """Test that X13 raises DataValidationError for insufficient data."""
    # Arrange
    short_series = pd.Series([1, 2, 3])  # Only 3 observations
    x13 = X13SeasonalAdjustment()
    
    # Act & Assert
    with pytest.raises(DataValidationError, match="insufficient data"):
        x13.fit(short_series)
```

## üìö Documentation

### Documentation Standards

- **API Documentation**: All public methods must have comprehensive docstrings
- **Type Hints**: All function signatures must include type hints
- **Examples**: Include usage examples in docstrings
- **Tutorials**: Create tutorials for complex features

### Docstring Format

We use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def seasonal_adjustment(
    data: pd.Series, 
    freq: str = 'auto',
    transform: str = 'auto'
) -> SeasonalAdjustmentResult:
    """
    Perform seasonal adjustment on time series data.
    
    This function applies the X13-ARIMA-SEATS methodology to detect
    and remove seasonal effects from the input time series.
    
    Args:
        data: Time series data to adjust
        freq: Data frequency ('M', 'Q', 'A', or 'auto')
        transform: Transformation type ('auto', 'log', 'none')
        
    Returns:
        Complete seasonal adjustment results including seasonally
        adjusted series, seasonal factors, and quality diagnostics.
        
    Raises:
        DataValidationError: If input data is invalid
        InsufficientDataError: If insufficient observations
        
    Examples:
        >>> import pandas as pd
        >>> data = pd.Series([100, 110, 95, 105])
        >>> result = seasonal_adjustment(data)
        >>> print(result.seasonally_adjusted)
        
    Note:
        For optimal results, use at least 3 years of monthly data
        or 8 quarters of quarterly data.
    """
```
