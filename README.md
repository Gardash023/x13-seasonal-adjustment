## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install x13-seasonal-adjustment
```

For development installation:

```bash
pip install x13-seasonal-adjustment[dev]
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import pandas as pd
from x13_seasonal_adjustment import X13SeasonalAdjustment

# Load your time series data
data = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv', index_col=0, parse_dates=True)

# Create and fit the model
x13 = X13SeasonalAdjustment()
result = x13.fit_transform(data['value'])

# Access results
print(f"Original series: {len(result.original)} observations")
print(f"Seasonally adjusted: {len(result.seasonally_adjusted)} observations")
print(f"Seasonality strength: {result.seasonality_strength:.3f}")

# Visualize results
result.plot()
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
from x13_seasonal_adjustment import X13SeasonalAdjustment

# Customize the seasonal adjustment process
x13 = X13SeasonalAdjustment(
    freq='M',                    # Monthly data
    transform='auto',            # Automatic transformation detection
    outlier_detection=True,      # Enable outlier detection
    outlier_types=['AO', 'LS'],  # Additive and level shift outliers
    arima_order='auto',          # Automatic ARIMA model selection
    x11_mode='multiplicative',   # Multiplicative decomposition
    enable_logging=True          # Enable detailed logging
)

result = x13.fit_transform(data)

# Access comprehensive diagnostics
print(f"ARIMA model: {result.arima_model_info['order']}")
print(f"Quality measures: {result.quality_measures}")
```

## üìä Core Components

### 1. X13SeasonalAdjustment (Main Class)

The primary interface for seasonal adjustment operations:

```python
from x13_seasonal_adjustment import X13SeasonalAdjustment

x13 = X13SeasonalAdjustment(
    freq='auto',                 # Data frequency detection
    transform='auto',            # Automatic log transformation
    outlier_detection=True,      # Outlier detection and correction
    trading_day=True,           # Trading day effect modeling
    easter=True,                # Easter effect modeling
    arima_order='auto'          # Automatic ARIMA model selection
)
```

### 2. Seasonality Testing

Advanced seasonality detection using multiple statistical tests:

```python
from x13_seasonal_adjustment.tests import SeasonalityTests

tests = SeasonalityTests()
result = tests.run_all_tests(data)
print(f"Seasonality detected: {result.has_seasonality}")
print(f"Test results: {result.test_results}")
```

### 3. Automatic ARIMA Modeling

Sophisticated ARIMA model selection with comprehensive diagnostics:

```python
from x13_seasonal_adjustment.arima import AutoARIMA

arima = AutoARIMA(
    max_p=3, max_d=2, max_q=3,           # ARIMA orders
    seasonal=True,                        # Seasonal modeling
    information_criterion='aicc'          # Model selection criterion
)
model = arima.fit(data)
forecast = model.forecast(steps=12)
```

### 4. Quality Diagnostics

Comprehensive quality assessment following X13 standards:

```python
from x13_seasonal_adjustment.diagnostics import QualityDiagnostics

diagnostics = QualityDiagnostics()
quality_report = diagnostics.evaluate(result)
print(quality_report)
```

## üî¨ Methodology

This library implements the complete X13-ARIMA-SEATS methodology:

1. **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and preprocessing
2. **Outlier Detection**: Detection and adjustment for various outlier types
3. **Automatic Model Selection**: ARIMA model identification using information criteria
4. **Seasonal Decomposition**: X11 algorithm with multiplicative/additive modes
5. **Quality Assessment**: M and Q statistics for result validation
6. **Forecasting**: Model-based forecasting and backcasting

### Supported Outlier Types

- **AO (Additive Outlier)**: Sudden spikes in individual observations
- **LS (Level Shift)**: Permanent changes in series level
- **TC (Temporary Change)**: Temporary departures from trend
- **SO (Seasonal Outlier)**: Seasonal pattern disruptions

## üìà Performance Benchmarks

X13 Seasonal Adjustment is designed for production environments:

| Dataset Size | Processing Time | Memory Usage |

- **Performance Monitoring**: Automated benchmarking and regression detection

## üìñ Examples

### Monthly Sales Data

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from x13_seasonal_adjustment import X13SeasonalAdjustment

# Generate sample monthly data
dates = pd.date_range('2010-01-01', periods=120, freq='M')
trend = np.linspace(100, 200, 120)
seasonal = 10 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * np.arange(120) / 12)
noise = np.random.normal(0, 5, 120)
data = pd.Series(trend + seasonal + noise, index=dates)

# Perform seasonal adjustment
x13 = X13SeasonalAdjustment()
result = x13.fit_transform(data)

# Analyze results
print(f"Seasonality strength: {result.seasonality_strength:.3f}")
print(f"Trend strength: {result.trend_strength:.3f}")
print(f"Quality rating: {result.decomposition_quality}")
```

### Quarterly Economic Data

```python
# Quarterly GDP data example
x13_quarterly = X13SeasonalAdjustment(
    freq='Q',
    transform='log',
    outlier_detection=True,
    arima_order=(2, 1, 2),
    seasonal_arima_order=(1, 1, 1)
)

result = x13_quarterly.fit_transform(gdp_data)
result.plot_seasonal_pattern()  # Show seasonal patterns
```
